### Groningen

I'm in my third year of my study Liberal Arts & Sciences. Back home I did a lot of programming courses before discovering that I wanted my main focus to be psychology. I felt like 'Neural Data Science' would be a perfect combination of these two interests. In Groningen I did a few introductroy psychology courses, like 'Love', 'War', and 'Social and Cultural Psychology'. Before starting my program I was already aware of the fact that I'm interested in people's thinking and behaviour and these courses just confirmed that this was gonna be my main focus for my studies. 

### Future

An essential part of a study in psychology is obviously statistics. I therefore needed to follow Statistics 1,2 and 3. Most of my classmates found this very uninteresting, whereas I discovered my interest in research. It made me discover that I want to do research psychology later in my life. After graduating I'm planning on doing the Research master of Behavioural and Social Sciences in Groningen. I'm sure that in this case programming skills would also be useful!
